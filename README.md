## Overview

The [Animal-AI Testbed](http://animalaiolympics.com/AAI) introduces the study of animal cognition to the world of AI. 
It provides an environment for testing agents on tasks taken from, or inspired by, the animal cognition literature.
Decades of research in this field allow us to train and test for cognitive skills in Artificial Intelligence agents.

This repo contains the [training environment](animalai), a [training library](animalai_train) as well as [900 tasks](competition_configurations) for testing and/or training agents.
The experiments are divided into categories meant to reflect various cognitive skills. Details can be found on the [website](http://animalaiolympics.com/AAI/testbed).

We ran a competition using this environment and the associated tests, more details about the results can be found [here](http://animalaiolympics.com)

The environment is built using [Unity ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs) and contains an agent enclosed in a fixed sized arena. Objects can spawn in this arena, including positive 
and negative rewards (green, yellow and red spheres) that the agent must obtain (or avoid). All of the tests are made from combinations of objects in the training environment. 

## TL;DR

Just want to get started? Then:
- Clone this repo
- In the `examples` folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Get the [environment executable](#requirements) for your platform
- In the `examples` folder, start `jupyter notebook` and go through the [environment](examples/environment_tutorial.ipynb) 
and the [training](examples/training_tutorial.ipynb) notebooks!

For more examples to run see [the examples folder](examples).

## Requirements

First **download the environment** for your system:

| OS | Environment link |
| --- | --- |
| Linux |  [download v2.0.1](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~bb1010/animalAI/env_linux_v2.0.1.zip) |
| MacOS |  [download v2.0.1](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~bb1010/animalAI/env_mac_v2.0.1.zip) |
| Windows | [download v2.0.1](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~bb1010/animalAI/env_windows_v2.0.1.zip)  |

Unzip the **entire content** of the archive to the `examples/env` folder. On linux you may have to make the file executable by running `chmod +x env/AnimalAI.x86_64`.

The Animal-AI packages works on Linux, Mac and Windows and requires python 3.

- The main package is an API for interfacing with the Unity environment. It contains both a 
[gym environment](https://github.com/openai/gym) as well as an extension of Unity's 
[ml-agents environments](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/ml-agents-envs). You can install it
 via pip:
    ```
    pip install animalai
    ```
    Or you can install it from the source by running `pip install -e animalai` from the repo folder

- We also provide a package that can be used as a starting point for training, and which is required to run most of the 
example scripts found in the `examples/` folder. It contains an extension of 
[ml-agents' training environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/ml-agents) that relies on 
[OpenAI's PPO](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/) and [BAIR's SAC](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/12/14/sac/). You can also install this package using pip:
    ```
    pip install animalai-train
    ```
    Or you can install it from source by running `pip install -e animalai_train` from the repo folder

**The Unity source files** for the environment can be found on our [ml-agents fork](https://github.com/beyretb/ml-agents). 

## Manual Control

If you launch the environment directly from the executable or through the `load_config_and_play,py` script it will launch
 in player mode. Here you can control the agent with the following:

| Keyboard Key  | Action    |
| --- | --- |
| W   | move agent forwards |
| S   | move agent backwards|
| A   | turn agent left     |
| D   | turn agent right    |
| C   | switch camera       |
| R   | reset environment   |

Paper with all the details of the test battery will be released after the competition has finished.

## Unity ML-Agents

The Animal-AI Olympics was built using [Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit.](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

The Python library located in [animalai](animalai) extends [ml-agents v0.15.0](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/0.15.0). Mainly, we add the 
possibility to change the configuration of arenas between episodes.

## EvalAI

The competition was kindly hosted on [EvalAI](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI), an open source web application for AI competitions. Special thanks to [Rishabh Jain](https://rishabhjain.xyz/) for his help in setting this up.
We will aim to reopen submissions with new hidden files in order to keep some form of competition going.
